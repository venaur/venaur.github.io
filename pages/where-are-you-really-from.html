            The exploration of the common question, “Where are you <i>really</i>  from?” was inspired by the
            conceptual structure of the Her Noise Archive. Irene Revell (2023) emphasized that the
            archive isn't just associated with “feminism”, but encompasses a broader theme of “power.”
            It’s designed to provoke power imbalances and explore the ways individuals can
            interrogate power relations and dynamics. The question itself, “where are you really
            from?,” holds a higher significance within this context, exploring how power dynamics not
            only dictate who poses the question but also influences who becomes the subject of these
            inquiries.
            <br> <br>
            For this project, I conducted four interviews, myself included. Each individual was either a
            transracial adoptee or someone with a diverse background. Some of the questions I posed
            included:
            <div class="indent"> 
                - How have you dealt with or responded to stereotypes and racism?
                <br>- Have you struggled with belonging?
                <br> - How would you imagine a future where questions like, “where are you <i>really</i> from?” may
                no longer be asked?
            </div>

            <br>
            Towards the end of the interviews, participants shared suggestions for more considerate
            ways to ask questions:
            <div class="indent"> 
            - What is your ethnicity?
            <br>- What is your background/heritage?
            <br>- What languages do you speak?
            </div>
        </div>

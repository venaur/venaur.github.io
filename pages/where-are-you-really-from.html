            The exploration of the common question, “Where are you <i>really</i>  from?” was inspired by the
            conceptual structure of the Her Noise Archive. Irene Revell (2023) emphasized that the
            archive isn't just associated with “feminism”, but encompasses a broader theme of “power.”
            It’s designed to provoke power imbalances and explore the ways individuals can
            interrogate power relations and dynamics. The question itself, “where are you really
            from?,” holds a higher significance within this context, exploring how power dynamics not
            only dictate who poses the question but also influences who becomes the subject of these
            inquiries.
            <br> <br>
            For this project, I conducted four interviews, myself included. Each individual was either a
            transracial adoptee or someone with a diverse background. Some of the questions I posed
            included:
            <div class="indent"> 
                - How have you dealt with or responded to stereotypes and racism?
                <br>- Have you struggled with belonging?
                <br> - How would you imagine a future where questions like, “where are you <i>really</i> from?” may
                no longer be asked?
            </div>

            <br>
            Towards the end of the interviews, participants shared suggestions for more considerate
            ways to ask questions:
            <div class="indent"> 
            - What is your ethnicity?
            <br>- What is your background/heritage?
            <br>- What languages do you speak?
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="block-titles">Installation Setup</div>
        <div class="setup-description">
            “Where are you <i>really</i> from?” will exhibit with a quadraphonic sound system, assigning
            each speaker to play the voice of one of the interviewees. A circular seating arrangement
            at the center of the speakers invites listeners to engage with the work and the seating
            encourages audiences to spend more time with the piece. The speaker height
            would be slightly lower to further encourage individuals to take a seat.
            
            The duration of the piece represents the time that it preciecly took for the interviewees to feel comfortable speaking. 
            This is the same amount of time I wanted to give to the audience 
            and have them listen to how we gradually unravel ourselves over time.

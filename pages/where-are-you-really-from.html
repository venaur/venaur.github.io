            The exploration of the common question, “Where are you <i>really</i>  from?” was inspired by the
            conceptual structure of the Her Noise Archive. Irene Revell (2023) emphasized that the
            archive isn't just associated with “feminism”, but encompasses a broader theme of “power.”
            It’s designed to provoke power imbalances and explore the ways individuals can
            interrogate power relations and dynamics. The question itself, “where are you really
            from?,” holds a higher significance within this context, exploring how power dynamics not
            only dictate who poses the question but also influences who becomes the subject of these
            inquiries.
            <br> <br>
            For this project, I conducted four interviews, myself included. Each individual was either a
            transracial adoptee or someone with a diverse background. Some of the questions I posed
            included:
            <div class="indent"> 
                - How have you dealt with or responded to stereotypes and racism?
                <br>- Have you struggled with belonging?
                <br> - How would you imagine a future where questions like, “where are you <i>really</i> from?” may
                no longer be asked?
            </div>

            <br>
            Towards the end of the interviews, participants shared suggestions for more considerate
            ways to ask questions:
            <div class="indent"> 
            - What is your ethnicity?
            <br>- What is your background/heritage?
            <br>- What languages do you speak?
            </div>
        </div>

                “Where are you <i>really</i> from?”  was presented using a quadraphonic sound system, where each speaker was designated to play the voice of one of the interviewees. Surrounding a circular seating arrangement positioned at the center of the speakers encouraged active engagement from the audience. The seating layout was designed to entice listeners to linger longer with the piece, with speaker height slightly lowered to prompt individuals to take a seat. The duration of the piece precisely mirrors the time it took for the interviewees to feel at ease speaking. This temporal framework was intended to afford the audience the same opportunity, allowing them to observe the gradual unfolding of personal narratives over time.

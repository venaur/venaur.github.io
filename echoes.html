    As someone who has experienced a difficult past, I turned to art initially as a means of therapy and self-expression. However, as I continue to grow and evolve, I question my motives and the role that creating art plays in my life. Is it merely a way to revisit and reconcile my past, or does it hold an alternative significance for my future? This piece is an exploration of that internal conflict. 
    <br><br>Using Pure Data and two speakers accompanied by acoustic structures, I create an immersive sound experience that gives the illusion of echoing. In this piece, the echoes serve as a metaphor for my past and internal chaos. They continue to reverberate in the present, becoming increasingly distant as time passes. I question how this distance will shape and influence my future decisions. 
    <br><br>The sound in this piece embodies a sense of ambiguity and uncertainty, much like my own personal journey. It also represents a willingness to embrace the unknown, the possibility of change, and forgiveness as I seek to transcend the limits of my personal experience.
